# VaR-and-ES-estimation
Hi!
These files contain the code and data I ran for my thesis in Econometrics. It also provides the thesis itself for background information or a light Sunday read.
Enjoy!

# Abstract of the project:
Banks are mandated to gauge market risk using internal models for Value-atRisk and Expected Shortfall. Broadly speaking, the models fall into three categories:
unconditional, conditional and quantile. Using these categories and also including
forecast combinations, we address two questions. First, we investigate which category of models provides ’adequate’ joint risk estimation at both a 1- and 5-day
holding period. Second, we test whether including time-varying components for the
link between VaR and ES enhances quantile models. A novel score-driven extension
is included to incorporate higher moments.
Using returns data from Morgan Stanley and HSBC in combination with rigorous
testing and the Model Confidence Set, we aim to find an empirical answer. Findings
highlight the underperformance of the unconditional models, even though it is used
by roughly 75% of the banks under ECB supervision. Moreover, the potential of the
forecast combination and quantile models is highlighted. The forecast combination
using all models appears to be a stable risk estimator, not over- or underestimating
the risk measures significantly. The time-varying component of the quantile models
does not appear to provide improved results. Altogether, this thesis stresses the
importance of more prudent model choices in risk evaluation.
